# Time to get serious

Now that I can say I'm pretty comfortable with `sklearn` at this point (despite some semantic misunderstandings in the previous repositories), I find myself wanting a lot more control with a lot more access to the statistics tied to linear regression. Enter `statsmodels`: a library that seems to be a key next step in the linear regression learning path.

I think I'm gonna spend a lot of time with this library, so this repository will cover pretty much any and all documentation on the usage of `statsmodels` in linear regression. As usual, thank you to any who might view this (although I'm aware I'm likely typing into the void), and my god do I love learning this stuff.

Here's to the next chapter of learning ðŸ¥‚.
